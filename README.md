# sf-foodtrucks-java

The goal was to create an app using Java, that would allow users to access the data from the shared spreadhseet to find all or specific food trucks in San Francisco. They should also be able to add, delete, and update food truck information as well.

I must submit this app as incomplete due to time constraints. I was unable to finish setting up the data table and server with MySQL, MySQL Workbench, and Tomcat. My Java files haves comments that note my logic and initial attempt in creating the functionality.
